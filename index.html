                        <p>This carefully designed handbook is my early Christmas gift to you as you gear up for the biggest adventure of your life! This is by far the most thought and time I have ever put into a gift for anyone, so if nothing else, this can be like when you get a book from someone and you feel obligated to read it, but in the end the pictures are the most entertaining part of it all! (I'll get you the download links for when you post your Survivor DUMP.)</p>
                        <p>It is broken down into 6 pages after this one, each page containing information I thought might be useful, vaguely interesting, or extremely important to remember. I used my world class expertise combined with Google Gemini to create all of the resources you find below. I adjusted the style of writing to try and make it more enjoyable to go through.</p>

                            <li><strong>Select Your Sources:</strong> Choose to use all uploaded resources for site research, or select specific items for context (e.g., only using SurvivorWiki and Reddit sources).</li>
                            <li><strong>Ask Anything:</strong> Use the chat box for questions, whether specific or broad (e.g., "What do past female contestants say is the most practical yet chic outfit they saw on their season?" or "Who has the most individual endurance competition wins in Survivor USA history?").</li>
                            <li><strong>Inquire About Videos:</strong> Ask questions related to videos in the database (e.g., "Summarize the most recent RHAP show with Coach Wade," or "On Au confessionnal avec Eric et Marilou, how did Eric feel about being portrayed as a villain?").</li>
                            <li><strong>Create Custom Content:</strong> Generate your own podcasts, videos, and infographics to aid understanding or memorization. Pre-made examples are available in the window on the right (e.g., "Generate an infographic displaying how you solve a 4x4 slide puzzle").</li>

                            <li><strong>The Sprint:</strong> The first 24 hours are for establishing social utility. Avoid being "tagged" as an early target.</li>
                            <li><strong>Old School Value:</strong> Survivor Québec values physical work. Haul supplies and build camp to signal commitment.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Mandate:</strong> Form a majority alliance (4-5 people) immediately. This is your shield.</li>
                            <li><strong>Production Tip:</strong> Use confessionals for branding. Watch the cameras; if they follow a player, an idol hunt is likely happening.</li>

                            <li><strong>The "No-Wall" Rule:</strong> Shelters have no walls. Lack of privacy accelerates bonding and conflict.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adversity is Good:</strong> Losing tribes often enter the merge with stronger bonds than winning tribes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Be Fluid:</strong> Expect "Kidnap" twists to disrupt alliances. Keep social lines open.</li>

                            <li><strong>Strategy Shift:</strong> This rule punishes aggressive play. You must minimize your "social debt" (votes against you) from Day 1.</li>
